# bisca-je
An implementation of the "Jogo da Bisca", which is a portuguese variant of the original italian game "br√≠scola".

## Content

The main purpose of this project is to explore Angular 2 and TypeScript and how can these interact with a REST API implmented with Spring 4.

## Context

The technologies usedi in this project range from TypeScript and Angular 2 in the front end to J2EE in the back end.

REST services are used and for this case Jersey and Jackson are used. In short:


* Angular 2 - Defines Front End.

* TypeScript - Code that is compiled before deployment with an OOP structure.

* Jersey - Implementation of the REST API and extensions for JAX-RS.

* Jackson - Provides mapping for POJOS.

* JAX-RS - Offers the binding and some limited mappings
